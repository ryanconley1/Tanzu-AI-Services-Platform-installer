# Tanzu GenAI Platform installer

TL;DR - A powershell script that automates the install of VMware Tanzu Platform, a private PaaS which includes AI services, on VMware vSphere with minimal resource requirements.

The installer takes minimum set of parameters, validates them, and then performs the install of the platform which includes Foundation Core (Tanzu Operations Manager), BOSH Director, Elastic Application Runtime, Postgres, and AI Services with models that have embedding, chat, and tools capabilities. Optionally, Tanzu Hub (global control plane with observability) can be installed.

The script, when ran after an install with "stop" or "start", can stop or start the whole Tanzu Platform.

Note:
- The script uses what is known as the Small Footprint Elastic Application Runtime which is a repackaging of Elastic Application Runtime into a smaller deployment with fewer VMs which is perfect for POC and sandbox work.
- There are some limitations with small footprint which can be found [here](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/elastic-application-runtime/10-3/eart/toc-tas-install-index.html#limits). 

For a much more comprehensive automated install of Tanzu Platform, which uses [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/), check out the [Platform Automation Toolkit for Tanzu](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/platform-automation-toolkit-for-tanzu/5-3/vmware-automation-toolkit/docs-index.html)

## Fill out required fields in the script
Update each instance of "FILL-ME-IN" in the script. See below for a worked example...

Update the path to the VMware Tanzu Operations Manager (OpsMan) OVA, Tanzu Platform for Cloud Foundry (TPCF) tile, Postgres tile, GenAI tile, and OM CLI
```bash
### Full Path to Tanzu Operations Manager OVA, TPCF tile, Postgres tile, GenAI tile, and OM CLI
$OpsManOVA    = "/Users/Tanzu/Downloads/ops-manager-vsphere-3.2.1.ova"
$TPCFTile     = "/Users/Tanzu/Downloads/srt-10.3.1-build.2.pivotal"
$PostgresTile = "/Users/Tanzu/Downloads/postgres-10.2.1.pivotal"
$GenAITile    = "/Users/Tanzu/Downloads/genai-10.3.1.pivotal"
$OMCLI        = "/usr/local/bin/om"
```

Update infra config fields
```bash
### Infra config
$VIServer          = "vcenter.tanzu.lab"
$VIUsername        = "administrator@tanzu.lab"
$VIPassword        = 'my-super-safe-password!'
$VMDatacenter      = "Tanzu-DC"
$VMCluster         = "Tanzu-Cluster"
$VMResourcePool    = "Tanzu-Platform-RP"
$VMDatastore       = "vsanDatastore"
$VirtualSwitchType = "VSS"       
$VMNetwork         = "tp-network-70" 
$VMNetworkCIDR     = "10.0.70.0/24"  
$VMNetmask         = "255.255.255.0"
$VMGateway         = "10.0.70.1"
$VMDNS             = "10.0.70.1"
$VMNTP             = "10.0.70.1"
```

Update Tanzu Platform config fields
```bash
### Tanzu Platform config
$OpsManagerAdminPassword  = 'my-super-safe-password!'
$OpsManagerIPAddress      = "10.0.70.10"       
$OpsManagerFQDN           = "opsman.tanzu.lab"            
$BOSHNetworkReservedRange = "10.0.70.0-10.0.70.2,10.0.70.10,10.0.70.30-10.0.70.254"  #add IPs, either individual and/or ranges you _don't_ want BOSH to use in the subnet eg Ops Man, gateway, DNS, NTP, jumpbox
$TPCFGoRouter             = "10.0.70.20"                                             #IP which the Tanzu Platform system and apps domain resolves to. Choose an IP towards the end of available IPs
$TPCFDomain               = "tp.tanzu.lab"                                           #Tanzu Platform system and apps subdomains will be added to this. Resolves to the GoRouter IP
$TPCFLicenseKey           = "xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx"                          #License key required for 10.2 and later
```

Update Tanzu Hub fields 
- Note; installing Tanzu Hub (global control plane with observability) is optional. Installing Tanzu Hub requires an additional 12 IP addresses, 10 GHz CPU, 96 GB mem, and 400 GB storage.
```bash
### Install Tanzu Hub (global control plane and observability)?
$InstallHub = $true
$HubTile    = "/Users/Tanzu/Downloads/tanzu-hub-10.3.1.pivotal"        #Download from https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=Tanzu%20Hub
$HubFQDN    = "hub.tanzu.lab"
```

## (Optional) Advanced Config
There are several advanced parameters which can be changed if wished, for example...

Number of compute instances
```bash
$TPCFComputeInstances = "1" # default is 1. Increase if planning to run many large apps
```

User provided cert for GoRouter. With $userProvidedCert set to false (default) the installer creates a self-signed cert
```bash
# User provided cert (full chain) and private key for the apps and system wildcard domains
# see https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/elastic-application-runtime/10-3/eart/security_config.html for details on creating this cert and key
$userProvidedCert = $false
$CertPath         = "/Users/Tanzu/certs/fullchain.pem"
$KeyPath          = "/Users/Tanzu/certs/privkey.pem"
```

AI models
```bash
# AI Services config
$OllamaEmbedModel = "nomic-embed-text"
$OllamaChatToolsModel = "gpt-oss:20b"
```

Airgapped / internet restricted environment 
```bash
# Be default, this script pulls the above models from Ollama (registry.ollama.ai). For internet restricted environments, you can download the models 
# separately using the links below and specify their location in the variables in the section below. This script will then create a MinIO object store, 
# upload the models to it, so the installer can then pull the models from it rather than from the internet.
#
# Please note, the MinIO BOSH Release is not Broadcom software, it is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html

# Install MinIO BOSH Release (an object store for AI models in internet restricted envs)

## Run the script
- Open a powershell console eg `pwsh`
- Execute the script eg `tanzu-genai-platform-installer.ps1`
- Installation can take approximately 2 or more hours. Install time depends on the performance of your underlying infrastructure and options selected. 

- Note; if this is your first time using Powershell with the VMware PowerCLI module, you may be prompted to participate in the VMware CEIP. You can accept/deny so not prompted again by running `Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -Scope User -ParticipateInCEIP $true or $false`

  - The script on completion will print out the admin credentials for Tanzu Apps Manager and CF CLI, alternatively, you can retrieve them via Tanzu Operations Manager > Small Footprint Elastic Application Runtime > Credentials > UAA > Admin Credentials

- Download CF CLI and login to the platform
  -  The script on completion will print out how to download cf cli and how to run `cf login`, alternatively, see the [install docs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/elastic-application-runtime/10-3/eart/cf-cli-install-cf-cli.html) and [login docs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/elastic-application-runtime/10-3/eart/cf-cli-getting-started.html#login-foundation)

- Create an Org and a Space
    - Create an Org
    ```bash
    cf create-org tanzu-demos-org
    ```
    - Create a Space
    ```bash
    cf create-space tanzu-demos-space -o tanzu-demos-org
    ```
    - Target an Org and Space
    ```bash
    cf target -o tanzu-demos-org -s tanzu-demos-space
    ```

- Download JDKs & SDKs
  - Note; [sdkman](https://sdkman.io) is a great tool for installing and managing many versions of various JDKs and SDKs
  - Java 21 or later
    - Install Java 21 if not already installed
    ```bash
    sdk install java 21.0.7-oracle
    ```
    - If already installed, make Java 21 the current candidate version, or which ever candidate version you have installed
    ```bash
    sdk use java 21.0.7-oracle
    ```
  - Maven 3.8 or later
    - Install Maven if not already installed
    ```bash
    sdk install maven
    ```
    - If you have Maven already installed, make Maven 3.8 or later the current candidate version, or which ever candidate version you have installed
    ```bash
    sdk use maven 3.9.10
    ```
- Download / Clone git repos
  ```bash
  gh release download v2.1.0 --repo cpage-pivotal/cf-mcp-client -D cf-mcp-client
  gh clone kirtiapte/bitcoin-mcp-server
  ```

## Deploy chat app

### Push the app to the platform
```bash
cd cf-mcp-client
cf push
```

### Access the app
1. Retrieve the URL to the app
```bash
cf apps
```

2. Open the app in a browser and ask it a question!


### Bind to a LLM model
1. View services available
```bash
cf marketplace
```

2. View genai services available
```bash
cf marketplace -e genai
```

3. Create a service instance that provides chat LLM capabilities
```bash
cf create-service genai chat-and-tools-model chat-llm
```

4. Bind the service to the app
```bash
cf bind-service ai-tool-chat chat-llm
```

5. Restart the app to apply the binding
```bash
cf restart ai-tool-chat
```

Now the chatbot will use the LLM to respond to chat requests

Ask it for the current price of bitcoin!


### Bind to services so can do RAG
1. View genai services available
```bash
cf marketplace -e genai
```

2. Create a service instance that provides embedding LLM capabilities
```bash
cf create-service genai embedding-model embedding-llm
```

3. View postgres services available
```bash
cf marketplace -e postgres
```

4. Create a Postgres service instance to use as a vector database

```bash
cf create-service postgres on-demand-postgres-db vector-db
```

5. Bind the services to the app

```bash
cf bind-service ai-tool-chat embedding-llm 
cf bind-service ai-tool-chat vector-db
```
Note; if it fails to bind the vector-db, it may be that the Postgres DB is still being created from the previous command. You can confirm by running "cf services" and checking the "last operation" field. 

6. Restart the app to apply the binding

```bash
cf restart ai-tool-chat
```

7. Click on the document tool on the right-side of the screen, and upload a .PDF File

Now your chatbot will respond to queries about the uploaded document

### Deploy a MCP server
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities to AI models through a standardized interface. These servers act as bridges between LLMs and external tools, data sources, or services, allowing your AI application to perform actions like searching databases, accessing files, or calling external APIs without complex custom integrations.

1. Build the app
```bash
cd ../bitcoin-mcp-server
mvn clean package
```

2. Push the app to the platform
```bash
cf push
```

3. Retrieve the URL to the bitcoin app
```bash
cf apps
```

4. Create a user-provided service that provides the URL for the bitcoin MCP server
```bash
cf cups bitcoin-mcp-server -p '{"mcpServiceURL":"http://bitcoin-mcp-server.apps.tp.tanzu.lab"}'
```

5. Bind the MCP service to your chatbot app
```bash
cf bind-service ai-tool-chat bitcoin-mcp-server
```

6. Restart your chatbot app
```bash
cf restart ai-tool-chat
```

Your chatbot will now register with the MCP server, and the LLM will be able to invoke the agent's capabilities when responding to chat requests

Ask it for the current price of bitcoin

Congratulations, you have come to the end of this quick start guide. We have barely scratched the surface of the GenAI capabilities of the platform, or the vast capabilities of the platform as a whole. To learn more, please see official documentation and resources below.

# Appendix

## Troubleshooting
- An install log can be found where you run the script from with a file name of tanzu-genai-platform-installer.log. It contains verbose logging.

- If you wish to just install up to a certain component, or skip a step, you can by changing the Installer Overrides flags in the Advanced Parameters section in the script
```bash
# Installer Overrides
$confirmDeployment = 1
$preCheck = 1
$deployOpsManager = 1
$setupOpsManager = 1
$setupBOSHDirector = 1
$setupTPCF = 1
$setupPostgres = $InstallTanzuAI
$setupGenAI = $InstallTanzuAI
$setupHub = $InstallHub
$ignoreWarnings = $false
```

- If the install of a component fails due to a permissions/privileges warning (verify in the installer log), you can override the warning by setting the ignoreWarnings flag to $true in the Advanced Parameters section of the script
```bash
# Installer Overrides
$ignoreWarnings = $true
```
